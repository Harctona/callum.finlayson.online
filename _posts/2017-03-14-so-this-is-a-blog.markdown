I'm not exactly sure what to write here this is mainly just a filler fist post for development purposes. I guess I'm going to use this site to outline the things i do in life, maybe pretend that they actually have some meaning. If someone is acually reading this right now then damn, you must be really bored. 

So, on here I guess I'm going to post tutorials and things for things I find online. This site will most likely be constantly unde development as is the nature with all websites I suppose. I guess that means just expect it to be broken. I plan to add as much as I can to it, perhapse even a section for people who have business enquiries. 

Speaking of such things, I may overhall
